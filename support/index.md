# Frequently Asked Questions about Sight Meter

**The app is missing the "Automatic" distance-to-blur measurement test. How do I measure my eyes?**

The distance-to-blur test requires an iPhone with a TrueDepth front facing camera such as a iPhone X or newer model.  I’ve included an additional “manual” way of entering the measurements if your phone doesn’t have TrueDepth. Select the "Self Reporting" eye test to enter the distances you've measured with a ruler. 

**My eyes are very myopic. I have to put the iPhone very close to my face in order to see text clearly. Will Sight Meter's distance-to-blur test work for me?**

The distance-to-blur test is normally used when not wearing any glasses or contacts. The test stops working if you hold the iPhone closer than about 18 cm from your face. This is how far someone who wears contacts of -6.00 diopters or stronger would hold it to see text clearly. 

  - If you normally wear contacts:
  
      Try wearing reading glasses over your contacts when taking the distance-to-blur test. That'll move the distance where text begins to blur closer to your face. Make sure you create and select a "Vision Profile" in Sight Meter that matches what you are using when taking the test.
  
  - If you normally wear glasses:
  
      Try switching to your "computer glasses" or glasses with a reduced prescription before taking the test. That'll move the distance where text begins to blur closer to your face. Make sure you create and select a "Vision Profile" in Sight Meter that matches what you are using when taking the test.
