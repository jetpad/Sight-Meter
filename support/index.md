# Frequently Asked Questions about Sight Meter

**The app is missing the "Automatic" distance-to-blur measurement test. How do I measure my eyes?**

The distance-to-blur test requires an iPhone with a TrueDepth front facing camera such as a iPhone X or newer model.  I’ve included an additional “manual” way of entering the measurements if your phone doesn’t have TrueDepth. Select the "Self Reporting" eye test to enter the distances you've measured with a ruler. 

**My eyes are very myopic. I have to put the iPhone very close to my face in order to see text clearly. Will Sight Meter's distance-to-blur test work for me?**

The distance-to-blur test stops working if you hold the iPhone closer than about 18 cm from your face. This is how far someone who wears contacts of -6.00 diopters or stronger would it to see text clearly (but isn't currently wearing contacts).
