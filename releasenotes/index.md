## Release Notes for Sight Meter

* 2019.7.5 - Initial release of Sight Meter
  - "Distance to Blur" test requires an iPhone with a TrueDepth front facing camera. The test also has the limitation of working between a blur depth of about 20 cm to 80 cm. If your vision is worse or better than that range, you won't be able to use that test to track your vision. 
  - The "Vision Profile" section of the app is working so that you can create profiles of the vision correction you are using. But there are no features that take advantage of it currently in the app. Future features will be built upon it. 
  
  For example, if your distance to blur is lower than 20 cm, the "Distance to Blur" test won't work for you. But wearing some +1.50 "reader" glasses may shift your blur distance far enough so it is in the 20-80 cm range. If you are taking the test wearing the readers, you would create and select a vision profile listing +1.50 readers. This will tell (a future version of) Sight Meter to display your "Distance to Blur" chart with *corrected* distances that were testing using the +1.50 readers.
